Notes on workflow for trench flexure for inverse model

1) prepare the data files
- set bounds
- extract topo grav, and agea
- map age into Mercator grid

2) make one vload file for all segments

3) set plate curvature grid to all zero

4) compute rigidity from curvarure and age

5) make a model using vload and rigidity to get W, curv,  and grav

6) exit after some number of iterations

7) go to 4)

Notes on doing inverse problem

1) prepare the data files
- set bounds
- extract topo grav, and agea
- map age into Mercator grid

2) make a unit vload and a unit mload for each segment
   2*num_segment vload files (vload)

3) set plate curvature grid to all zero

4) compute rigidity from curvarure and age (curv2rigid)

5) make 2 * num_seg deflection models for W, curv, and grav (flex2d)

6) sample every model at locations of W_data and grav_data (grdtrack)

7) invert for the V and M of each segment (invert)

8) take this best set of V and M and, compute combined vload (vload)

9) make a combined model using vload and rigidity to get W, curv, and grav (flex2d)

10) go to 4 to recompute rigidity grid from combined curvature and age

11) exit after some number of iterations
